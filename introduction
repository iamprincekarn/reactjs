I have started learning reactjs from today from thapa technical

reactjs :

#it is a library not a framework - 
A library is like a toolbox full of tools that developers can use to build their applications. They choose which tools to use and how to use them to build their application.
A framework is like a blueprint for building an application. It provides a pre-designed structure and set of rules that developers must follow to build their application. Developers fill in the details within the framework to make their application work.
In short, a library is a collection of tools, while a framework is a pre-designed structure that provides a set of rules and conventions for building an application.


#it provides component based apporach - 
break the UI into different component then write code once and use anywhere it in the program.
