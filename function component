// if we are exporting any component using named export for example, like this
export const Greet = () => <h1>Hello, Prince</h1>
// then we have to import this in any other component using the same name as the component name here (here Greet).



// if export is deafult then we can import using any name
import React from 'react'
const Greet = () => <h1>Hello, Prince</h1>
export default Greet;
// now we can import this component by any name in any other component
